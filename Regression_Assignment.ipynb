        "-->If a Multiple Linear Regression model has a high \\( R^2 \\) but a low adjusted \\( R^2 \\), it suggests that the model may be overfitting the data. Overfitting occurs when the model captures noise or random fluctuations in the data rather than the true underlying relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "The adjusted \\( R^2 \\) accounts for the number of predictors in the model and penalizes the addition of unnecessary variables. A large difference between \\( R^2 \\) and adjusted \\( R^2 \\) indicates that some of the predictors may not be contributing meaningfully to the model and are instead adding noise. This can lead to a model that performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",

        "To address this, you can consider simplifying the model by removing less significant predictors or using techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to new data."

        "-->Scaling variables in Multiple Linear Regression is important for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Improves Model Performance**: Scaling ensures that all variables contribute equally to the model, preventing any single variable from dominating due to its larger scale.\n",
        "2. **Enhances Interpretability**: It makes the coefficients more interpretable, as they represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the scaled independent variable.\n",
        "3. **Speeds Up Convergence**: Scaling helps optimization algorithms converge faster, leading to more efficient model training.\n",
        "4. **Reduces Multicollinearity**: It can help reduce multicollinearity by ensuring that variables are on a similar scale, improving the stability of the model.\n",
